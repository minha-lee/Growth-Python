class growth():


#Growth is a multi-functional modeling tool.
#Its versatility extends for individual geometry and also for edges that they belong to.
#The x,y,z, angles and scales are changeable, but at least one edge and one angle should be selected.
#It is automatically set to randomize the entirety of the geometry with every click of the button "grow".
#But, the user can select any edge of the geometry and adjust its extrusion values. 
#Also, if one selects a lone edge and click "grow", the edge itself becomes a changing line that can be manipulated.
#The user can then opt to click on the entire geometry and click "grow" again to extrude the faces out 
#of the line that is made out of various edges. 
#In summary, Growth has three main functions:
#1) controlled geometry extrusion based on x,y,z choices
#2) randomized geometry extrusion after the first click of "grow"
#3) controlled and randomized extrusion of the edges of a given geometry.
